# Henry Lin Portfolio

## Description

This is my portfolio containing my bio and some of my technical projects that I have completed within the last year. 

Creating a personal webpage is a must in being a tech proffessional. This is why I also wanted to create my on webpage. Howver, doing this without 3rd party sources allows me to customize as well as learn the many features of React, javascript, html, css, etc. When applying for positions, it is very difficult to get to know the person who you are trying to hire just with a resume and cover letter. Additionally, it is wasteful and time consuming for both ends to submit and read multiple documents. A personal web page is a convenient and quick way for employers to get to know who you are. I can also fit a lot more content on a web page than on paper.
